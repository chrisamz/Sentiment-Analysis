# Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews and Social Media Data

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer reviews and social media data to gauge public sentiment about a brand or product. By understanding public sentiment, businesses can make informed decisions to improve their products, services, and overall customer satisfaction. The project demonstrates skills in natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, text classification, word embeddings, and using advanced models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data from customer reviews and social media platforms. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Customer reviews, social media posts (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), product feedback.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights into the factors contributing to public sentiment.

- **Techniques Used:** Data visualization, summary statistics, word frequency analysis, word clouds.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Create features from text data using techniques like word embeddings and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

- **Techniques Used:** TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), sentence embeddings, BERT embeddings.

### 4. Model Building
Develop and evaluate different models to perform sentiment analysis and text classification.

- **Techniques Used:** Logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, deep learning models (LSTM, CNN), BERT.

### 5. Sentiment Analysis
Implement sentiment analysis to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

- **Techniques Used:** TextBlob, VADER, custom sentiment models using machine learning and deep learning.
